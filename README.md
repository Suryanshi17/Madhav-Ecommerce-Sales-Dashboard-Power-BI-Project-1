Title - Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

I am uploading my Project 1 files here in this repository.
This project visualizes key sales metrics for Madhav Store across various regions in India. The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of online sales performance, enabling data-driven decisions through its interactive design and clear insights. Through this project, I was able to transform raw sales data into actionable insights, supporting decision-making processes at every level.

The Key Insights are as follows - 

1. "Total Sales" - ₹438K from 5615 units, generating ₹37K in profit and an AOV of ₹121K.
2. "Top Regions" - Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh lead in sales.
3. "Customer Leader" - Harivansh drives the most revenue.
4. "Profit Trends" - August, October, and November were peak months for profit, while May, June, July, and December saw slight dips.
5. "Best-Selling Categories" - Clothing, Electronics, and Furniture topped sales, with Printers and Bookcases leading in profits.
